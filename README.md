# BCDint

## algorithms
- "ricf_dg" is the BCD algorithm (Drton et al. 2019) for directed graphs (without bidirected edges)  
- "ricf_int" is an old version of BCD algorithm for interventional data  
- "ricf_int2" is the BCD algorithm for interventional data

## simulations
- "generateModel" is data generation process of simulations
- "simulationcyc" is the simulation and evaluation of one single configuration $(v.n.l.d)==(p,m,k,d)$

## maximum likelihood degree computation
- "ML_deg" is Mathematica code for maximum likelihood degrees for an example, observational data and observational + interventional data

# BCDint

## Algorithms
- **`ricf_dg`**: BCD algorithm (Drton et al., 2019) for directed graphs (without bidirected edges)  
- **`ricf_int`**: Legacy version of the BCD algorithm for interventional data  
- **`ricf_int2`**: Current BCD algorithm for interventional data

## Simulations
- **`generateModel`**: Data generation process used in simulations  
- **`simulationcyc`**: Runs simulation and evaluation for one configuration $(v, n, l, d) = (p, m, k, d)$

## Maximum Likelihood Degree Computation
- **`ML_deg`**: Mathematica code to compute the maximum likelihood degrees for an example model using both observational and interventional data
